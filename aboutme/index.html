            My name is Tessa Dashner and I am from Berryville, Virginia. I am a Sophmore studying 
            Computer Science. I have been here for 6 semesters but this is my first semester
            in this major. 
            
            I am the oldest of 4 girls and i've been in the church since birth. I love camping, hiking, reading, and everything in between.
            I'm hoping to learn a lot in this class and figure out what I want to do for my career!
            My favorite scripture at the moment is D&C 11:12-13.
