        My idea for my personal site is selling t-shirts that have invisible ink on them. The idea is that these t-shirts will only show the ink through various circumstances, like water, heat, and movement. 
        People will want to come to my site if they are under top secret missions and need secretive shirts. These shirts will come with an invisible ink that my audience can also buy refills of if they want to make a shirt of their own. 
        People can see awesome photos of example t-shirts and get to decide what type of invisible ink they want on their shirt. This also applies to the type of ink they want to be buying. 
        Some questions that can be answered on this site would be questions about how to activate the various types of ink, what size they can buy their shirt at, the price, how to buy refills on invisible ink, and how to contact us for support. 
        Buyers would have to input their top secret code name, secret bunker address, secret bank account number, and secret telephone number. Only this site is known to be trusted throughout all of the big important people who go on top secret missions.
        This site never gives out your personal top secret information to the public and will always have your back with supplies near you!

      <h3>Refills</h3>
      <p>
        This page is for refills on invisible ink (but it'll be empty jars). If they come back with a complaint they will be sent to a classified page 
        (you're not allowed to contact this top secret place)
        A big part of this page is having different types of ink bottles that represent the different types of invisible ink and how they're activated. 
        You will have a type, quantity, price, and shipping information to be placed in each order.

      <h3>Contact Us</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be a page for contact support. If something goes wrong and additional help is being needed,
        you can contact secret headquarters for help and they will answer any missed questions that weren't on the FAQ provided.

        This is a page that will sell jars of invisible ink (but they will be empty bottles) and pens that are just fancy looking quils but 
        supposedly writes in 'said' invisible ink. If you ever need to buy the ink for the t-shirts, this is where you'll get them!

      <h3>Contact Us</h3>

        This page will basically be a giant image (not optimized) that says "CLASSIFIED" so that no one can contact anyone
        OR
        This will be a page that will have images of facebook and instagram, but they will all be classified information
